## The Odds of a Standing Coin

There are not many statitics about how a Pue will stand on its own, i.e. standing on the edge. However, some posts and even some papers have tried to statistically calculate the odds of a coin standing on its edge.

Upon quick search on the Internet, here is a Reddit post:

The coin will stand on its own if the angle between the axis parallel to the surface and the ground is between `90 - arctan(T/2R)` and `90 + arctan(T/2R)` when the coin loses all its internal kinetic energy.

Take a 10 New Taiwanese Dollar coin for example. Its diameter is 26mm and its thickness is 1.88mm (source: https://www.cbc.gov.tw/public/data/issue/money/A2/100th10.htm ). The result is about 4.5%.

This seems extremely high at first, but in reality, the rotation of the coin will almost certainly knock the coin away from this position. Simply taking the above parameters to the equation is not enough.
